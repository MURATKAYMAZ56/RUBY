To run the examples in this training, you need the full texts of "Romeo and Juliet" and "Hamlet". Unfortunately, even if the texts itself have been common domain for centuries, specific versions of the texts carry license notes from the distributors–and I'm not allowed to remove those notes and incorporates the texts in this training. Here is how you can retrieve those texts on your own.

1. Go to a site that distributes the texts of Shakespeare. I used https://shakespeare.folger.edu/, but you can find them in multiple places on the Internet.
2. Download "Romeo and Juliet" and "Hamlet", in text format.
3. Rename the files respectively to `romeo-juliet.txt` and `hamlet.txt`.
4. Open the files in a text editor and delete all the text (license notes and anything else) that isn't part of the play itself, both before and after the text.
5. Copy the files to the directory where you'll run this training's examples.

The entire operation should take a few minutes. I wish I could take this annoying work off your back, but copyright laws can be… well, not very rational, especially if you delve into the jungle of international copyright. Thank you for your understanding, and enjoy the training!
